### About this blog

This blog was once [described](http://danluu.com/programming-blogs/) as

> ... the theme is “things Julia has learned recently”, which can be anything from 
> [Huffman coding](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/02/22/how-gzip-uses-huffman-coding/) to how to be happy when
> working in a remote job. When the posts are on a topic I don’t already know, I learn something
> new. When they’re on a topic I know, they remind me that the topic is exciting and contains a lot
> of wonder and mystery.

> Many posts have more questions than answers, and are more of a live-blogged exploration of a topic than an explanation of the topic.

This is a pretty accurate assessment of what I'm going for :)

This blog is about

* being delighted about programming
* showing how topics traditionally considered "hard" and "scary" are actually accessible and interesting and fun ([TCP!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/21/why-you-should-understand-a-little-about-tcp/) /  [Kernel hacking!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/01/04/4-paths-to-being-a-kernel-hacker/) /  [Traceroute!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/31/day-20-scapy-and-traceroute/) /  [gzip!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/24/day-16-gzip-plus-poetry-equals-awesome/) /  [databases!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/27/how-does-sqlite-work-part-1-pages/) /  [SSL!](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/01/31/whats-tls/))
* [asking questions and getting better every day](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/).
* how being clear & curious & humble is better than sounding like I know it all already
* experimenting with alternative ways to teach hard concepts ([zines!](https://jvns.ca/zines/))

I'm trying to create a small corner of the internet which is never condescending or rude or
dismissive and where I just talk about learning hard things and _doing_ hard things in a practical
and friendly way.

### Talking to me

This blog doesn't have comments. However, a huge part of why I write this blog is that people who
read this blog (you!) have taught me so many interesting and useful things over the years by helping
me solve problems I write about, pointing me to useful resources, and correcting in a kind way when
I (frequently) make mistakes. Thank you. I love hearing from you.

If you have a quick question/comment, I'm on Twitter at https://twitter.com/b0rk, and I talk to
people there all the time. Twitter is effectively the comments section for this blog.

My email address is julia@jvns.ca.

### About me

I'm a software developer. I live in Montreal. I work at Stripe, on infrastructure. I read all my email and try to respond. I sometimes give [talks](http://jvns.ca/talks). I've published a collection of [awesome free programming zines](https://jvns.ca/zines/).

I have one main opinion about programming, which is that deeply understanding the underlying systems
you use (the browser, the kernel, the operating system, the network layers, your database, HTTP,
whatever you're running on top of) is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and be
able to solve hard problems.

I spent the fall of 2013 at the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com), which
houses the best programming community I've seen anywhere. I wrote down 
[what I did every day while there](http://jvns.ca/categories/hackerschool/), if you want to know what it's like.
