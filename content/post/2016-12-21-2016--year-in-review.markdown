I'm mostly writing this for me, but maybe it will be interesting to you
too! Here's are some things that happened in 2016.

### a new zine!

I wrote another zine in 2016! Here's the cover.

<a href="http://jvns.ca/debugging-zine.pdf"> <img src="/images/debugging-tools-cover.png"></a>

I'm really happy with how this one turned out. I also made a dedicated
page at <a href="http://jvns.ca/zines">jvns.ca/zines</a> where you can
read all of the zines.

I'm working on another zine right now about computer networking which
should be out in January or so.

### comics!

I drew a comic about programming every day in November. This turned out
AWESOME. Way better than I thought they would. You can
read them all at <a href="http://drawings.jvns.ca/">drawings.jvns.ca</a>

It's been really interesting to see how many people LOVE learning basic
stuff about operating systems (assembly! threads! the stack! floating
point!). Often the things I go over that I think are relatively basic
are the ones where people respond "wow, I had no idea how that worked,
that's really cool!" (and they're right! It IS really cool!)

It's somewhat shocking to me that some people now refer to me as an
"artist" given my sorta nonexistant drawing skills, but, hey, whatever
works :). It's been a really good way to communicate ideas.

### talks!

I 

* [keynoted RustConf](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/09/11/rustconf-keynote/)
* [spoke at PyData Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvF-KbgymXo)
  about some reasons to be skeptical about / excited about
  machine learning (also, I went to Berlin for 6 weeks! That was fun!)
* [talked at Strange Loop about linux debugging tools](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/09/17/strange-loop-talk/) (and gave the same talk at PolyConf)
* [did a lightning talk at !!Con about how to trick neural networks](https://youtu.be/7_DX1EGKZXY)
* spoke at CUSEC about how understanding operating systems fundamentals
  is important

Doing the RustConf keynote was kind of scary (me??? keynote???) but I think it
turned out well and I'm happy I did it. I'm still not a huge Rust
programmer but I love the community and I'm happy with the talk I gave.

It's looking like 2017 will be the year of Julia going to a few
operations / SRE conferences, so watch out for that. I like going to new
conferences instead of going to the same ones all the time.

### cool: writing about work

This year I wrote my first work blog post (on [service discovery at Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/service-discovery-at-stripe). This is a kind of weird thing
to celebrate (I've written way way more on this blog), but it made me
surprisingly happy to be able to write in public about some of the stuff I
work on. I guess I like being able to write a little bit at work. I also
worked on a [job description](https://stripe.com/jobs/positions/infrastructure-engineer) for my job.

I've been thinking a little about Kelsey Hightower's advice to [not let your job title limit your impact](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/808443443118686208).

I like that I have some flexibility in my job to do things like write
blog posts / try to make our job descriptions better / organize [events featuring some of my favorite speakers](https://stripe.com/events/lightning-talks-and-pie-dec2016).
My new manager is supportive of me doing that stuff which makes me happy.

### also cool: switching to infrastructure

Last year I wrote:

> Apparently I like writing about how things work, and how to make
> computers go fast. I did some fun performance optimization at work.
> Maybe I will do more of that next year!

I did a little more performance optimization work in 2016, and I was
maybe hoping to do even more, but that did not seem to be what the
company needed. That's okay! I did get to learn how A LOT OF THINGS WORK
THOUGH. I switched to the team that's responsible for networking
+ code deployment + running programs ("like heroku, but harder to use") and it's
really fun partly because it's my job to understand a lot of the
nitty-gritty details about how all of our infrastructure works.

And then now that I understand how a lot of it works, I can make it
better! So that's what I've been doing. I really like my new team a lot.
It's harder to explain and less fancy sounding than "machine learning"
but it's awesome so far.

### seeing a thing I worked on ship

Last year at this time I was excited about interpretable machine
learning algorithms (how do you know *why* the machine learning model
decided to do that thing?) because I think it's important for users of
those models. This year stripe released a machine learning
product called [Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) that gives you a
reason for why the ML model made the decision it did (you can see examples at [the docs here](https://stripe.com/docs/radar/risk-evaluation))!

About a bajillion awesome people worked on this, and I worked on the
machine learning system behind it for a while so it's awesome to see it
in real life.

### blogging

I wrote 87 blog posts this year, and I think about 70,000 words. So!

a few I liked:

* I liked writing [this discussion of how rkt runs containers](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/11/03/what-happens-when-you-run-a-rkt-container/) because I think it's important to be able to walk through what a complex piece of software is doing when you run it (if not necessarily rkt specifically)
* [a critique of the CAP theorem](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/11/19/a-critique-of-the-cap-theorem/) because I would maybe eventually like to understand more about distributed systems
* [learning to like design documents](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/06/03/learning-to-like-design-documents/) has been kind of a theme this year -- I'm trying to get better at designing and iterating on systems
* I learned [how a CDN works](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/29/cdns-arent-just-for-caching/), [why UDP packets get dropped](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/24/find-out-where-youre-dropping-packets/), and a lot more about networking
* this [collection of drawings about Linux](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/11/10/a-few-drawings-about-linux/)
* this [post about how stock options work](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/12/30/do-the-math-on-your-stock-options/) helped me understand how stock options work, which was useful (technically from the dying days of 2015)
* [how much memory is my process using?](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/12/03/how-much-memory-is-my-process-using-/) was a long standing mystery in my head and I finally understand (I think) all the basic facts about virtual memory on Linux. Victory.

### some conclusions

I think I got a little better at figuring out [what to work on](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/)
this year. I know more about operating systems fundamentals and networking than I did at
the beginning of the year. I can write a slightly better design document
than before. I didn't have RSI problems in 2016.
