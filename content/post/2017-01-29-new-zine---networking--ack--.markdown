HI FRIENDS. In December, I started writing a zine about computer
networking! In it, I explain everything that happens when you download
[this image](http://jvns.ca/cat.png) from the internet, in as much
detail as I can fit in 24 pages.

Have you been seeing cool drawings about networking concepts on Twitter
from me, and wondering "Julia, I really want to have all of these
in one place, how can I get that??"? This is what I was working on!

Here's the (amazing) cover, by rad programmer [Liz Baillie](https://twitter.com/_lbaillie).

This zine explains:

* how packets are put together
* all the steps to download a cat: DNS, sockets, TCP connections, HTTP,
  and TLS
* networking notation
* networking layers
* what even is a "port"
* and more!

I'm really excited about this -- I spent a really long time being
confused about how any of this networking stuff worked AT ALL, and I'm
hoping this zine will help some people understand a few more things. 

Also I am worried about what is happening in the world this week, and
I wanted to do a small thing to help.

So! You can get this networking zine TODAY. Here's how.

1. Donate to the ACLU ([here's the link](https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu))
2. Fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/emmcpzBeo3CdddgE3) with your email address and some
   proof
3. I'll email you the awesome zine within 24 hours.

If you donate $150 I will print you a zine and mail it to you. (I will
mail up to, say, 50 zines.)

After we raise $5000 for the ACLU (or after 2 weeks), I'll
put it online for free at [https://jvns.ca/zines](https://jvns.ca/zines).

# FAQ

**I already donated to the ACLU! Can I get a zine?**

Yep! Just say "I donated this morning" or something when you fill out the form!

**I can't / don't want to donate to the ACLU but I would like to get the zine!**

I'll put it on my website for everyone to download sometime in the next
couple of weeks.


# Current amount raised: ~$1175 / $5000

Also people have sent me evidence of like $4300 of preexisting donations
that are I have sent them zines too. You all are great.

I'll update this counter manually every day. I'm mostly leaving out
