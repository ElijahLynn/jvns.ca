HI FRIENDS. In December, I started writing a zine about computer
networking! In it, I explain everything that happens when you download
[this image](http://jvns.ca/cat.png) from the internet, in as much
detail as I can fit in 24 pages.

Have you been seeing cool drawings about networking concepts on Twitter
from me, and wondering "Julia, I really want to have all of these
in one place, how can I get that??"? This is what I was working on!

Here's the (amazing) cover, by rad programmer [Liz Baillie](https://twitter.com/_lbaillie).

This zine explains:

* how packets are put together
* all the steps to download a cat: DNS, sockets, TCP connections, HTTP,
  and TLS
* networking notation
* networking layers
* what even is a "port"
* and more!

I'm really excited about this -- I spent a really long time being
confused about how any of this networking stuff worked AT ALL, and I'm
hoping this zine will help some people understand a few more things. 

You can get it TODAY. Here's how.

1. Donate to the ACLU ([here's the link](https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu))
2. Fill out [this form](todo: link) with your email address and some
   proof
3. I'll email you the awesome zine.

Also, if you donate $150 I will print you a zine and mail it to you.

After we raise $5000 for the ACLU (or after 2 weeks, whichever happens
second), I'll put it online for free at
[https://jvns.ca/zines](https://jvns.ca/zines).

# Current amount raised: $0 / $5000
