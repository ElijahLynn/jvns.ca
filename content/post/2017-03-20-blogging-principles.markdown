I wrote this set of blogging priciples on Twitter a while back and thought I'd
mirror it to this blog. These principles help me publish stuff. (publishing
stuff on the internet is hard!).

Here's a text version of the comic:

### be honest about what I know

I constantly write things on this blog like "I'm not sure about this part...".
I try to not be falsely modest (when I do actually know something, I try to
just state it without hedging), but when I don't know something, I say so.

I like doing this because it lets me write about things a little out of my
comfort zone without worrying about misleading someone.

### try to not write anything (too) wrong

I write a lot of things that are a little bit wrong on this blog. I don't edit
that carefully, and I make mistakes all the time. I do try to avoid overly
egregious errors though -- if I'm *really* sketchy on the details of
sometimes, I do a little research to make sure that I don't have it totally wrong.

It turns out that making minor mistakes in public isn't that big of a deal --
people sometimes send me corrections, and they're always really nice about it.

### be positive

None of these are meant to be prescriptive, but this one least of all.

I don't really write negative posts. I think negative posts are important and
interesting and valuable but they are not generally what I write.

(just from today, this [post "epoll is fundamentally broken"](https://idea.popcount.org/2017-03-20-epoll-is-fundamentally-broken-22/) is a very good read) 
### write for a past version of myself

The easiet audience for me to write for is myself! For example, yesterday I wrote a post about a
tracing tool called ftrace. The reason I wrote it is that I was frustrated that
I couldn't find a single post that explained what ftrace was and how to use it in
a clear way. So I wrote the post that I wish I'd had when I was getting
started.

This means I also refer back to my own blog a lot -- I put all my favorite
ftrace links in that post, and I've already used it as a reference to find the
articles I like.


### stick to my own experience

I don't usually like to give advice ("you should do X"). Instead I usually just
tell stories about my own experience with something, and then people can decide
for themselves if that will work for them.

### talk about what I've learned recently

I like to write about things right after I've learned them. Usually then the
experience of learning the things is fresh in my mind ("can you BELIEVE this
thing about the Java garbage collector?!") and I can more easily communicate
what is confusing about it to a beginner.

At this point I'm pretty good at learning a thing and then turning around after
2 days and teaching it to someone else.

### remember it's OK if not everyone likes it

I write some blog posts that are way more popular than others. The all-time most popular post on this blog is [Questions I'm asking in interviews](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/) from 2013.
It's good that I'm not waiting to write another post that's as popular as that
one because i may not ever succeed :)

I write about machine learning and containers and linux and meta stuff like
asking questions and careers, and I'm pretty sure there is no single person who
is actually interested in all of it. That's okay! I follow all kinds of
blogs where I am only interested in like 30% of the posts. I LOVE those blogs.

It's always tempting to try to optimize my posts to get the most possible page
views, but it's more important to me to just be able to frequently post small
things that I find interesting.
