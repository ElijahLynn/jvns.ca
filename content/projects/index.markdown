A few programming projects I've done that are on the internet. Most of them (except rbspy) are small
fun projects that I did in less than a week.

* [rbspy: a Ruby profiler](#rbspy) (2018)
* [Computers are *fast*](#computers-fast) (2016)
* [Pandas Cookbook](#pandas-cookbook) (2014)
* [Visualizing Git workflows](#visualizing-git) (2013)

<a href="https://rbspy.github.io/">rbspy</a> is a sampling profiler for Ruby! I took a 3-month
sabbatical from work (Jan-March 2018) to build it. Some links:

* [series of blog posts about the project](https://jvns.ca/categories/ruby-profiler/)
* the [documentation](https://rbspy.github.io)
* the project [on github](https://github.com)

A game to teach you that computers are fast: https://computers-are-fast.github.io/. To me the fun
thing about this game is that even though I built it, I still get the questions wrong all the time
(how many times *can* a C program loop in a second??) I did this project with [Kamal Marhubi](http://kamalmarhubi.com).

Fun fact: questions from this game have been used on a college midterm!

    <a href="https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook"> Pandas Cookbook </a>
</h2>

https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook is an tutorial on how to use Pandas, the amazing Python data
analysis library. I made this on a 12-hour train ride in 2014 and it's helped a surprisingly large
number of people learn pandas, judging from the number of stars/forks :)

This is a fun small tool to visualize how you use git! You give it your git history and it gives you
a graph.
