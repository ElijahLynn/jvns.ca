### what's a zine?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzine):

> A fanzine (blend of fan and magazine or -zine) is a nonprofessional and
> nonofficial publication produced by fans of a particular cultural phenomenon
> (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share
> their interest.

I love programming and debugging tools (is that a "cultural phenomenon? I
don't know!"), so I make zines about how much I love them and give them away.
When I have time (and the printing budget) I like to give them out as handouts
in my talks.

<h3 id="strace-zine">strace zine</h3>

strace is my favorite program. I think that it doesn't get enough attention
from programmers, so I wrote a zine about it to teach more people about how to
use it.

The easiest way to read this is [on your computer (PDF)](http://jvns.ca/strace-zine-unfolded.pdf).

But the **best** way to read it is to print it out, staple it, fold it, read it, and then give it to a friend. It turns out it's way easier to convince your friends to read a physical thing that is in front of them.

Printers are kind of annoying, but people do successfully print it and send me [pictures](https://twitter.com/pinkhairedcyn/status/589149587333591041). Here's the [pdf for printing. Have fun.](/strace-zine-portrait.pdf) (there's also a [landscape version](/strace-zine-landscape.pdf))

It's available under a creative commons license 
([CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)), so you can print as
many as you want to give away.

<h3 id="linux-debugging-tools"> Linux debugging tools you'll love </h3>

This is a zine about some of my favorite Linux debugging tools, especially tools that I don't think are as well-known as they should be. It covers `strace`, `opensnoop`/`eBPF`, and `dstat`! `netcat`, `netstat`, `tcpdump`, `wireshark`, and `ngrep`! And there's a whole section on `perf` because perf is the best.

If you don't know what any of those tools I just mentioned are -- PERFECT. You
are who this zine is for!!! Read it and find out why I love them! Also, a lot
of these tools happen to work on OS X :)

As usual, there are 3 versions. If you print it, you can print as many as you
want! Give them to your friends! Teach them about tcpdump!

* version to read on your <a href="http://jvns.ca/debugging-zine.pdf">computer</a>
* print version: <a href="http://jvns.ca/debugging-zine-print-letter.pdf">letter</a>
* print version: <a href="http://jvns.ca/debugging-zine-print-a4.pdf">A4</a>

The cover art is by [Monica](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf), who is the best.
