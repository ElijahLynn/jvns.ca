Ever wanted to know how to use tcpdump, but were intimidated by all the command line options? I was too! But then I learned it, and it wasn't as bad as I thought. In this zine we'll explain:

* what kinds of questions you can answer with tcpdump
* how to interpret tcpdump output
* which command line arguments are the really important ones
* how to write a BPF filter to filter tcpdump output

<a href="#networking-ack" style="color: black">
<h3 id="networking-ack"> ★★★ Networking! ACK! ★★★</h3>
</a>
</div>

This is a zine about COMPUTER NETWORKING! I spent a very long time
learning how networking works (what happens when you download a picture
from the internet? It turns out, a lot!) So I wrote a zine about it!

Cover art by the amazing [Lee Baillie](https://twitter.com/_lbaillie).

<div align="center">
<a href="#strace-zine" style="color: black">
<h3 id="strace-zine"> ★★★ strace zine ★★★</h3>
</a>
</div>

strace is my favorite program. I think that it doesn't get enough attention
from programmers, so I wrote a zine about it to teach more people about how to
use it.

* version to read on your <a href="/strace-zine-v2.pdf">computer</a>
* print version: <a href="/strace-zine-v2-print.pdf">letter</a>
* you can buy <a href="https://www.stickermule.com/marketplace/15188-strace?utm_swu=8122">strace stickers</a>

<div align="center">
<a href="#linux-debugging-tools" style="color: black">
<h3 id="linux-debugging-tools">★★★  Linux debugging tools you'll love ★★★ </h3>
</a>
</div>

This is a zine about some of my favorite Linux debugging tools, especially tools that I don't think are as well-known as they should be. It covers `strace`, `opensnoop`/`eBPF`, and `dstat`! `netcat`, `netstat`, `tcpdump`, `wireshark`, and `ngrep`! And there's a whole section on `perf` because perf is the best.

If you don't know what any of those tools I just mentioned are -- PERFECT. You
are who this zine is for!!! Read it and find out why I love them! Also, a lot
of these tools happen to work on OS X :)

<h3 id="prod-ml">Production machine learning </h3>

This is a tiny zine, not as fancy as the others. 

<div align="center">
<a href="/production-machine-learning.pdf"><img src="/images/prod-ml-cover.png" width="300px"></a>
</div>

* [version you can read on your computer](/production-machine-learning.pdf)
* [version you can print and staple and fold](/production-machine-learning-print.pdf)

If you like it, you should read the PDF that it's based on: [Rules of Machine Learning:
Best Practices for ML Engineering](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf), which I found out about thanks to [Avi Bryant](https://twitter.com/avibryant).

<h3 id="whats-a-zine">What's a zine?</h3>

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzine):

> A fanzine (blend of fan and magazine or -zine) is a nonprofessional and
> nonofficial publication produced by fans of a particular cultural phenomenon
> (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share
> their interest.

I love programming and debugging tools (is that a "cultural phenomenon? I
don't know!"), so I make sometimes make fanzines about how much I love them and give them away.
When I have time (and the printing budget) I like to give them out as handouts
in my talks.

The easiest way to read any of these is on your computer.

But the **best** way to read them is to print it out, staple it, fold it,
read it, and then give it to a friend. It turns out it's way easier to
convince your friends to read a physical thing that is in front of them.

Printers are kind of annoying, but people do successfully print them and
send me [pictures](https://twitter.com/pinkhairedcyn/status/589149587333591041).

They're all available under a creative commons license 
([CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)), so you can print as
many as you want to give away.



<h3 id="print-directions">Printing directions</h3>

To print any of these:

* open the print version
* print double sided, choose to flip on the "long edge"

### other drawings

I have a lot of other drawings about programming. You can find them at
