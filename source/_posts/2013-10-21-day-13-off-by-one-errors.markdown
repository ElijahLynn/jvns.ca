Today I spent most of the day figuring out that

~~~
n_to_read = head.hlit + head.hdist + 257
~~~

should be

~~~
n_to_read = head.hlit + head.hdist + 258
~~~

And I still don't know why, exactly. In related news, I can now *almost*
decompress gzipped files.

I think the life lesson here is "sometimes it takes forever to figure
things out and it is no fun" :)
