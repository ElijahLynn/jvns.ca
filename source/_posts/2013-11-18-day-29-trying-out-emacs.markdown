At Hacker School I've been watching all the Lisp wizards with their
emacs attached to magical running Lisp processes where they can change
and reload the code in real time. And I am officially jealous.

So I am trying out emacs! Tomorrow I will write Clojure and
use [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/) to generate music and it
will be wonderful.

And there was a fantastic talk today by [Will Byrd](http://webyrd.net/)
about logic & relational programming where he showed how to
automatically generate quines and it was mindblowing and fun. So I
think I'm going to end up playing with Clojure's core.logic a bit,
because fun.

Definitely using evil mode, though, because I haven't spent years
practicing vim keybindings for nothing =).
