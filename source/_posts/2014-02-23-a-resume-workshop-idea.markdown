I want to run a resume-writing workshop sometime, because I remember
having *no idea* what to do when I was a student. I was talking to
[Kamal](https://twitter.com/kmrhb) about this a few weeks ago, and we
realized we had the same non-advice:

"When I was helping with hiring, and I had to wade through a stack of
100 resumes to pick who to interview, I understood much better how to
write a resume."

Which is true, but really not helpful if you don't have that
experience and are trying to get a job. So how about this 2 hour
workshop:

1. Get 50 people who work in the same field. (I'm thinking CS students
   here)
2. Print 50 copies of everyone's resume.
3. Give everyone a stack of 50 resumes and tell them to pick 5 people
   to interview in 30 minutes.
4. Put people in groups of 3-4 and have them discuss the resumes and
   agree on 5 people to interview for 30 minutes.
5. Pair people up and have them give each other tips on how to improve
   their resumes for 20 minutes

I like this because it's not about experts telling you what the right
and wrong thing to do is. It's instead about thinking through the
process from the other side, and coming to your own conclusions about
what the people hiring you might be looking for.

I don't have a title, though!

(I talked about this at the end of
[Switching Sides](https://medium.com/philosophy-logic/5ba3aa4df8f2),
but I like this idea a lot. I'd love ideas for making it better in the
comments.)
