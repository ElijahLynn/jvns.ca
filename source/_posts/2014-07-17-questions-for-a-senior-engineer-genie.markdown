The amazing [Julia Grace](https://twitter.com/jewelia) asked on
twitter:

> If you are early in your eng career, what types of topics

If you're reading this, you should also know about her
[Tips for Women: Finding Software Engineering Jobs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFOWFfIjQkBLlEsfmwttqmG-vB-FmWn39I1y6Kz9whM/edit).
Almost all of it applies to all people looking for tech jobs, not just
women.

So! This got me thinking! If I had a super wise senior engineer friend
who lived next door and I talked to all the time, what would I ask
them questions about?

I realized that these questions sound like "uh julia is your job
terrible" ("how do I handle being condescended to?" =D) . But I'm
largely just extremely interested in proactively avoiding terrible job
situations! For instance, I really hate being condescended to so even
if it happens very rarely so I would like to learn how to make it
never happen :) And some of these are things that don't happen to me
at all, but I've seen friends dealing with.

Another thing about these questions is that I'm not actually
interested in Twitter responses to them or comments -- if you know me
IRL and you find them interesting, talk to me about them!

I am also interested in more questions! I love questions.

Most of these are not really about tech at all! A lot are general "how
to deal with weird social situations at work" discussions.

Okay cool now we've made it past "JULIA ARE YOU OKAY" (yes), "ARE ALL
THESE THINGS HAPPENING TO YOU RIGHT NOW" (no), "ARE ANY OF THEM"
(sure! everyone has to deal with technical disagreements!) "I KNOW ALL
THE ANSWERS WHERE CAN I SUBMIT THEM" (no) and "THESE AREN'T EVEN
QUESTIONS ABOUT TECH" (yes).

Here are the questions / topics. Maybe you will find them useful and
have conversations about them!

* How to find mentors? How do you know if you're doing well? How to
  become a senior eng :-)
* Strategies for building consensus on technical decisions among a
  bunch of smart people with very different opinions
* How do you know when you should quit your job?
* How to do good work and also go home and go biking
* How to handle your organization being subtly sexist / racist /
  classist in a way that you can't specifically call out because it's
  not a specific incident.(see
  [The Ping-Pong theory of Tech Sexism](https://medium.com/matter/the-ping-pong-theory-of-tech-world-sexism-c2053c10c06c))
* Strategies (when interviewing for a job) for avoiding toxic work
  environments so you don't have to quit
* How to handle being condescended to by people who know more (or even
  who don't!).
* How to decide when to agree with someone more senior and when to
  push back. (because it's not "just because you really thnk you're
  right")
* What to do if people don't take you seriously as a developer
* Making sure you learn new things while employed.
* Deciding what language to write a new project in
* Processes for avoiding security holes in your code (though this is
  really an org-level thing)
* MEETINGS. How to be an effective awesome person in meetings so that
  you contribute something useful and people listen to you
* When to escalate issues you're having and when... not to
* How to know when you should ask for a raise (?!!)
* How to choose which projects to work on (assuming you have choice
  about this)
* How to build a good relationship with your manager.
* How to handle having a bad manager, or a manager who you don't work
  well with.
* How to have technical disagreements constructively without making it
  personal
* How to be an awesome coworker who everyone wants to work with! (be
  helpful? be super reliable? give good estimates? great code review?
  build things quickly? all of the above? SO MANY AXES)
