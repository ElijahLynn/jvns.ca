The first programming conference I went to was DrupalCon. I met a lot of really great people, was impressed with the community, went to some of the open source sprints. It was awesome.

At the beginning of the conference, someone said to me "yeah, after you go once or twice you don't really go to the talks any more -- you won't learn anything."

Now, I won't discount how important meeting people at conferences is. But I've heard a *lot* of people say that they don't go to conference talks, and I've experienced the same thing -- sometimes I'll be at a conference, and I'll go the the talks, and I just do not learn anything from a lot of the talks I choose to go to. Even at some major conferences, which are renowned for having super high talk standards!

Before I get into this, I want to say -- overall I think all the organizers of the conferences I go to do a fantastic job and I know they're largely super hardworking volunteers. I've worked on [organizing a conference before](http://bangbangcon.com). This isn't about how those conferences suck. They're great. But I want to think about how some of the talks could be better! 

In this post, I'll try to outline a few ways I think individual conference speakers can give better talks, and also some ideas (tested & untested) for encouraging high talk quality in your conference.

### what's a good talk?

I'm going to define "good talk" really narrowly -- I don't care how much the speaker says 'um' or whether they're unprepared. To me, a good talk is one where I learn something new or come away with some change in perspective. The more I learn / the more the speaker makes me think differently about something, the better.

### how do you make a good talk?

**Talk about something you didn't build.**

Talks about how awesome your company or product is are hard.

I've only seen a few really good examples of this. For instance, Paul Hildebrant gave a wonderful talk at PyCon last year about how Disney uses Python. It was 100% about how amazing Disney is and how cool it is to be at Disney, and it was also super interesting to see how they use Python. He had unusual examples, great visuals, and was a great presenter. A+ would listen to Disney propaganda again. 

I gave a talk about some open source software I built once and honestly? It wasn't a great talk. I had to build a narrative about why the thing I built was useful, instead of being able to focus exclusively on what would help the audience. And I do think the software is kinda useful! But I think that for the most part, software *other* people build is probably a lot more useful and interesting to an audience and I'd rather talk about that (here's my favorite Python package! here's a cool database I found! check out this thing I found out about Debian!).

When you talk about something you didn't build, you're automatically a lot more credible -- if the people who wrote [sysdig](https://sysdig.org) told me how great it was I'd be like "idk maybe", but if someone unconnected to the authors gave a talk about it? I'd be way more likely to be check it out after.

**Give a short talk**

1 hour talks are extremely hard to pull off. I see a lot of people give 30 minute talks which only have 10-15 minutes of content in them. Often I get invited to give 45 minute talks and just... end 15 minutes early because I only have 30 minutes of things to say. Nobody has ever complained to me about this.

At my favorite conference, [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com), all the talks are 10 minutes. The quality is *extremely* high (I think higher than any other conference I've been to), partly because there's never any filler or fluff. If you take someone relatively new to speaking and tell them "hey, pick an extremely interesting topic and prepare 10 minutes of material", they're basically set up for success. You can't put in irrelevant or boring stuff! There's no time!!! This is a great hack to help new speakers give great talks.

**Aim your talk at beginners**

At conferences like PyCon, more than half of the attendees have never been to PyCon before. A ton of people at conferences are beginners, and I think for conferences like PyCon some super solid beginner material is always 100% welcome. I've seen a lot of super wonderful and successful introductory talks which pick a subject a ton of people are interested in (how to build a web scraper! how to refactor Python code! [what's HTTP](http://confreaks.tv/videos/osbridge2015-http-can-do-that)?) and give a well-put-together introduction to the topic without assuming a ton of background. A+.

But, you can't build a conference only out of beginner-level material! If you did, you'd end up in exactly the situation I said I was frustrated about, where you can't learn from any of the talks after going a few times!

**Get a lot of feedback on your talk**

Once my partner said to me "oh, I didn't realize how much work you put into your talks -- on stage you look like you're just hanging out, but actually you worry about them for weeks beforehand" and I was like "YES EXACTLY".

I live in deathly fear of giving talks where my audience won't learn what I want them to learn, so a few weeks beforehand I'm like OMG I NEED TO WRITE A DRAFT. OMG I NEED TO PRACTICE. Then I start harassing my partner to listen to me and tell me if I'm making sense. He is very wonderful.

here is a recipe I use for getting feedback:

1. write a talk (or part of a talk)
1. give it to a person who is part of my target audience. ask them what they learned, and what didn't make sense to them
1. if they can't come up with anything they learned, I need to work harder.

Sometimes my feedback-ees are nice and they are like "yeah it was cool but i didn't learn anything" and I'm like NO IT IS NOT COOL IF YOU DO NOT LEARN ANYTHING. Then sometimes they tell me things they would like to have learned and things they didn't feel they needed and it's the best.

Also sometimes people tell me "oh i didn't understand this but it's fine" and I'm like "NO!! you are one of the people I wanted it to make sense to! How could I fix it so that you would understand?!" Usually they have super great suggestions and then I can make it better.
