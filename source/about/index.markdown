Hi! I'm Julia.

I normally live in Montréal, Canada. Right now I'm at [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com)
in New York working on becoming a better programmer. It is AWESOME.

Most of my programming experience is around web development (I made my
first CGI script with Perl in 2005). Since then I've learned bits and pieces of
Python, Java, PHP, Perl, C, Haskell, and SML. I spent a year doing
[Drupal](http://drupal.org). Those people know how to do supportive and awesome
open source community. I also spent the last year working as a data scientist.


At night, I spend time

* Playing with [bixi](http://bixi.com) data, and other data
* Organizing ([Montréal All-Girl Hack Night](http://mtlallgirlhacknight.ca))
* Doing things for [Montréal Python](http://montrealpython.org) and [PyLadies](http://mtl.pyladies.com). 
  The Python community in Montréal is fantastic and I love it.
* Cooking (sometimes) exciting things

I'm interested in:

* contributing more to open source
* learning more statistics
* if programming classes can help reduce income inequality
* getting into hardware hacking
* Python!
* data analysis (for making the world a better place?)
* ameliorer mon français
* eating mangoes


If you're interested in talking about any of these things, get in touch! I'm julia {at} this domain.
