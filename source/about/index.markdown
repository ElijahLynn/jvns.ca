### About this blog

This blog is about

* being delighted about programming.
* ZINES. I wrote [a zine about strace](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/04/14/strace-zine/) and if you read it, it would make my day.
* making technical topics easy to understand ([TCP!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/21/why-you-should-understand-a-little-about-tcp/) [Kernel hacking!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/01/04/4-paths-to-being-a-kernel-hacker/) [Traceroute!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/31/day-20-scapy-and-traceroute/) [gzip!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/24/day-16-gzip-plus-poetry-equals-awesome/) [databases!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/27/how-does-sqlite-work-part-1-pages/))
* clickbait titles (and hopefully making you happy you clicked.)
* [asking questions and getting better every day](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/13/asking-questions-is-a-superpower/).
* how being clear & EXCITING is more important than sounding smart
* feelings, occasionally ([Programming doesn't belong to men (it belongs to me)](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/12/28/programming-doesnt-belong-to-men-it-belongs-to-me/), [why I don't feel guilty about not contributing to open source](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/04/26/i-dont-feel-guilty-about-not-contributing-to-open-source/))
* being a wizard. seriously I wrote a guide to [how to be a wizard programer](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/638365065926811648). it's like 3 steps but it takes probably 20 years.

There's an occasionally-updated [list of favorite posts](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/favorite/).

If you want to comment on a blog post I write, I'll see it fastest if you [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/b0rk).

Thank you for reading ‚ù§.

### About me

I live in Montreal. I work at Stripe, on machine learning. My email address is [julia@jvns.ca](mailto:julia@jvns.ca). I sometimes give [talks](http://jvns.ca/talks).

I have one main opinion about programming and it's -- understanding the underlying systems you use (the kernel, the operating system, the network layers, your database, HTTP, whatever you're running on top of) is essential if you want to do amazing work and be able to fix hard problems. It's served me well so far.

My happiest internet accomplishment to date is that someone gave out my strace zine to their operating systems class and tweeted a picture at me. omg.

I spent the fall of 2013 at the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com), which
houses the best programming community I've seen anywhere. I wrote down [what I
did every day while there](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/hackerschool/), if you
want to know what it's like.
