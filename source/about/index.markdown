I live in Montreal and work on [Stripe](https://stripe.com)'s machine learning
team. You can find me elsewhere on the internet:

* [http://github.com/jvns](http://github.com/jvns)
* [http://twitter.com/b0rk](http://twitter.com/b0rk)

My email address is [julia@jvns.ca](mailto:julia@jvns.ca).

This blog is mostly about having fun with systems programming, with lots of
forays into other areas. You can look at a list of my [favorite posts](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/favorite/), an incomplete list of [talks](http://jvns.ca/talks/) some
[projects](http://jvns.ca/projects/) I've worked on.

I spent the fall of 2013 at [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com), which
houses the best programming community I've seen anywhere. I wrote down [what I
did every day while there](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/hackerschool/), if
you want to know what it's like.

A few things I've worked on:

* [Montreal All-Girl Hack Night](http://www.meetup.com/Montreal-All-Girl-Hack-Night/) (currently active!)
* [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com), a 2-day conference about what excites us
  about programming, where all the talks are lightning talks (together with several amazing people)
* co-founded [PyLadies Montreal](http://www.meetup.com/pyladiesmtl/), which is currently run by other awesome people.
