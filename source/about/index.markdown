Hi! Iâ€™m Julia.

I live in Montreal and work on [Stripe](https://stripe.com)'s machine learning
team. You can find me elsewhere on the internet:

If you want to learn about
what kinds of programming things I like, you should read my
[blog](http://jvns.ca/blog/archives/) or [projects](http://jvns.ca/projects/).
There's a list of my [favorite posts](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/favorite/).

I spent the fall of 2013 at [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com), which
houses the best programming community I've seen anywhere. I wrote down [what I
did every day while there](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/hackerschool/), if
you want to know what it's like.

In the last year or two I've discovered that I like organizing community events
and giving [talks](http://jvns.ca/talks) about programming. I co-founded
[Montreal All-Girl Hack Night](http://mtlallgirlhacknight.ca) with my awesome
friend [Monica](http://notwaldorf.github.io), as well as [PyLadies
Montreal](http://www.meetup.com/pyladiesmtl/).
