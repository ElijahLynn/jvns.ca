Hi! I'm Julia.

I live in Montréal, Canada, and work as a data scientist and programmer
for some [nice people](http://viascience.com) during the day. My
background is in pure math (I have a master's in the algebra of quantum
computing), and right now I'm taking an excursion into the real world
to see what it's like.

So far the real world is _awesome_.

Most of my programming experience is around web development (I made my
first CGI script with Perl in 2005). Since then I've learned bits and pieces of
Python, Java, PHP, Perl, C, Haskell, and SML. I spent a year doing
[Drupal](http://drupal.org). Those people know how to do supportive and awesome
open source community.


At night, I spend time

* Playing with [bixi](http://bixi.com) data, and other data
* Organizing ([Montréal All-Girl Hack Night](http://mtlallgirlhacknight.ca))
* Doing things for [Montréal Python](http://montrealpython.org) and [PyLadies](http://mtl.pyladies.com). 
  The Python community in Montréal is fantastic and I love it.
* Cooking (sometimes) exciting things

I'm interested in:

* contributing more to open source
* learning more statistics
* if programming classes can help reduce income inequality
* getting into hardware hacking
* Python!
* data analysis (for making the world a better place?)
* ameliorer mon français
* eating mangoes


If you're interested in talking about any of these things, get in touch! I'm julia {at} this domain.
