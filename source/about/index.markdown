Hi! Iâ€™m Julia.

I live in Montreal and work on [Stripe](https://stripe.com)'s machine learning
team. You can find me elsewhere on the internet:

* [http://twitter.com/b0rk](http://twitter.com/b0rk)

This blog is mostly about having fun with systems programming, with lots of
forays into other areas. There's a list of my [favorite posts](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/favorite/), as well as some
[projects](http://jvns.ca/projects/) I've worked on.

I spent the fall of 2013 at [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com), which
houses the best programming community I've seen anywhere. I wrote down [what I
did every day while there](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/hackerschool/), if
you want to know what it's like.

In the last year or two I've discovered that I like organizing community events
and giving [talks](http://jvns.ca/talks) about programming. A few things I've worked on:

* [Montreal All-Girl Hack Night](http://mtlallgirlhacknight.ca) with my awesome
  friend [Monica](http://notwaldorf.github.io)
* [PyLadies Montreal](http://www.meetup.com/pyladiesmtl/).
* [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com), a 2-day conference about what excites us
  about programming, where all the talks are lightning talks (with several
  amazing people)
