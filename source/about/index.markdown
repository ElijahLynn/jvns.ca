I live in Montr√©al, Canada, and do data mining at a [pretty cool company](http://viascience.com).

A few things I'm interested in right now:

* playing with arduinos
* organizing around women in technology ([hack night!](http://mtlallgirlhacknight.ca))
* Python!
* data analysis (for making the world a better place?)
* eating mangos
* learning more statistics

I like meeting new people, so if you'd like to chat, get in touch! I'm julia {at} this domain.
