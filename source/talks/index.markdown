I've given a couple of talks about how to use Python for data analysis.
Here are the videos:

* PyCon Canada, August 2013: [Diving into Open Data with IPython Notebook & pandas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7ATdTvtsKs). 
* Montr√©al Python, September 2013: [Diving into Open Data with IPython Notebook & pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXJH5XbEDI&list=PLQIcnBElABasalrbgiJWJVoNoN0ym6Yz7&index=4). 
  This is the same talk as the previous one, but I think this video is better.
