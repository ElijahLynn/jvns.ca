### what's a zine?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzine):

> A fanzine (blend of fan and magazine or -zine) is a nonprofessional and
> nonofficial publication produced by fans of a particular cultural phenomenon
> (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share
> their interest.

I love programming and debugging tools (is that a "cultural phenomenon? I
don't know!"), so I make zines about how much I love them and give them away.
When I have time (and the printing budget) I like to give them out as handouts
in my talks.

### strace zine

strace is my favorite program. I think that it doesn't get enough attention
from programmers, so I wrote a zine about it to teach more people about how to
use it.

The easiest way to read this is [on your computer (PDF)](http://jvns.ca/strace-zine-unfolded.pdf).

But the **best** way to read it is to print it out, staple it, fold it, read it, and then give it to a friend. It turns out it's way easier to convince your friends to read a physical thing that is in front of them.

Printers are kind of annoying, but people do successfully print it and send me [pictures](https://twitter.com/pinkhairedcyn/status/589149587333591041). Here's the [pdf for printing. Have fun.](/strace-zine-portrait.pdf) (there's also a [landscape version](/strace-zine-landscape.pdf))

It's available under a creative commons license 
([CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)), so you can print as
many as you want to give away.

### but, julia, it says "zines!" plural! there's only one here!

Yep. Watch this space.
